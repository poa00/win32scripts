In a batch script, you can check the errorlevel variable to determine the exit code of the last executed command. Typically, an exit code of 0 indicates success, and non-zero values indicate errors. Here's a basic list of some commonly used exit codes:

0: Success
1: General error
2: Incorrect syntax
3: Access denied
4: Not enough memory
5: Access code invalid
6: Program invalid
9: The environment is invalid
10: The file name or extension is too long
11: The file is not found
15: The system cannot find the drive specified
16: The directory cannot be removed
17: The system cannot move the file to a different disk drive
128: There is a syntax error in the script
